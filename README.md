# Advertising-Dataset---Exploratory-data-analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Classification

In this project, we worked on an advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We performed Exploratory Data Analysis and developed several Machine Learning Classification models that predicts whether or not a user will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

This data set contains the following features:

- 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
- 'Age': cutomer age in years
- 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
- 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
- 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
- 'City': City of consumer
- 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
- 'Country': Country of consumer
- 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
- 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
